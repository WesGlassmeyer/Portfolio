      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have been working as a metal fabricator for the past 15 years and I am looking to make a career transition into the tech industry. I discovered through experimenting with various free coding resources that I was able to find a shared passion in coding as I do in metal fabrication, I love to build things. Outside of work I am an avid jiu jitsu practioner and coach. I also enjoy spending time in the backcountry of Colorado interacting with the environment through hunting and fishing.  </p>
